            <h5>Tallahassee, FL â€¢ July, 2014</h5>
            <p><strong>Railroad Square Jiu-jitsu</strong> is a club for practitioners of Brazilian Jiu-jitsu.  Our motto is &ldquo;Mutual welfare, mutual benefit,&rdquo; and we foster a friendly environment while learning one of the fastest growing and effective martial arts in the world.</p>

        <div id="about">
            <p>Brazilian Jiu-jitsu (BJJ), historically derived from ground fighting techniques in Judo, is a martial art and popular competition sport more similar to Grecco-roman wrestling than striking martial arts.  Students can exert themselves physically at 100% which not only makes it excellent exercise and strength training but also conditions them to be level-headed if an attacker is trying to overwhelm them. The techniques are designed for smaller and weaker people to defend themselves against bigger and stronger assailants. It is also popular in mixed martial arts. Although some of our students take other martial arts, we only teach Brazilian Jiu-jitsu.</p>

                <h4 class="hide">Adriano Lucio</h4>
                <p>Adriano Lucio is a fourth-degree black belt from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, under Jos&#233; &ldquo;Z&#233;&rdquo; Marcello and Murilo Rupp in the lineage of Carlson Gracie Sr. and he represents <a href="http://braziliantopteam.com/">Brazilian Top Team</a>.  Adriano gives two-day seminars at our club 4 to 5 times every year at additional cost.  All belt tests are given by Adriano, and students who pass are awarded diplomas from BTT. He has trained BJJ for 20 years. When he is in the United States, he is training almost every day with students all through the Southeast and coaching them in tournaments. Among his many <a href="http://www.adrianolucio.com/home.jsf">accomplishments</a> and contributions to the martial arts, he recently won Vice State Champion in the light weight division and State Champion in open division FJJ Rio 2014, Rio de Janeiro.</p>

                <h3>Classes</h3>
                <p>Our classes are held 4 nights out of the week.  3 nights of the week contain instruction and drills, followed by sparring (&ldquo;rolling&rdquo;).  The remaining night is sparring only. Because we operate as a club, we try to work around the group&#39;s varying schedules and life commitments.  We have college students with final exams and parents with kids, so our <a href="#schedule">schedule</a> can change, but the classes are all in the evening. The club is for adult men and women and currently the student ages range from early 20s to 40s. Sorry, it is not for kids.  There are many other martial arts schools in Tallahassee with kids&#39; programs.</p>
                <h3>Railroad Square</h3>
                <p>As the name would suggest, we are located in Railroad Square Art Park at <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/1026+Commercial+St/@30.4329293,-84.2940332,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x88ecf5138357c39b:0x3df056fa498ded4a">1026 Commercial St.</a> in Tallahassee, Florida. The facility is conveniently located adjacent to FAMU campus and just south of FSU campus and &ldquo;College Town,&rdquo; making this ideal for students at either college.</p>
